# KisanForces
My project, Kisanforces, is an online judge web application that is designed to help users improve their problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms.
It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
The authentication is done using Passport.js, which ensures that only logged-in users can add, delete, and edit problems on the platform.

The global state management of the application is done using the powerful Redux toolkit, which allows for easy and efficient management of the application's state.
React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useLocation, and useSelector were used throughout the development process to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

The database for the application is stored using Mongoose, which is a powerful MongoDB object modeling tool. It allows for easy and efficient management of the data within the application.
This makes it easy for users to add, delete, and edit problems on the platform.

Overall, Kisanforces is a powerful and user-friendly online judge web application that is designed to help users improve their problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms.
With its robust and efficient use of modern web development
